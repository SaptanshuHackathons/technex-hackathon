/prd  Now its time to integrate the backend with the extension. I have been assigned the task of developing the extensionand I would like you to only work on the files inside the extension folder.

This is the problem we are working on: Build an AI system that converts any website into a context-aware
chatbot using URL input. The solution should crawl website content,
implement a RAG pipeline, answer queries accurately using only
website data, support follow-up questions, and minimize
hallucinations.

The developer will setup a file or config somewhere which will contain all the routes of the website where he would like our extension  to crawl/scrape data from. Using the data, our RAG bot will be designed. Use the data from all the crawled pages and then make the chatbot run the queries it will be asked via the chat.
Also can you make the theme same as the screenshot - a mix of white and orange?
Also create some test website and stuff to test out if the RAG Bot is working or not.

Work on planning this by reading every file in the project and then deciding what to do
